# cat-community
### Project #2 | Full Stack Application
URL: https://feedr-community.herokuapp.com/

**Objective of Application:**
 To allow tracking of community cats by their carers and followers.

**Technology:**
- MVC framework
- Sign up/log in functionality with hashed passwords & authorization flow
- Node.js, Express.js, React.js
- PostgreSQL
- AJAX, DOM manipulation
- Bootstrap
- Heroku, Cloudinary

**Approach:**
1. Research and prepare a Proto Persona:
- Bio/Background - feeder.
- Needs/Goals - feed the cat.
- Frustrations/Challenges - do not know where the cat is, do not know if cat was fed.
2. Identify a Problem Statement:
- User Story - [user] needs [cat's info] so as to [follow up].
3. Prototype wireframes for the application.

5. Code the functions of the application.
6. Set up Front End of application.
7. Integrate Front and Back ends of code.
8. Deploy to Heroku.

**Learning Journey:**
- Wireframing and ERD diagrams help greatly in scoping and creating functionality for the application.
- Having a basic Front End framework from the start can reduce functions required that can be solved by UI.

**Furthers:**
- To incorporate API for entering of addresses.
- To incorporate Cloudinary widget for uploading of images.
- To provide status update of cats.
- To see latest activities of followers.
- To add tables for vet visits.
